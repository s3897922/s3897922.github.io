      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <h4>
      The first thing I noticed when opening the Luni website was the 3D
      Modelling and interactive elements. The way that the design moves along
      with the cursor motions gives the website more dimension, which I found
      more appealing rather than the usual flat coloured website designs.
